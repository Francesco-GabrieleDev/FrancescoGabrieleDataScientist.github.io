Overall Structure of Project Section:
Example Layout for Each Project Card

Visual: Large enough to catch attention, representative of the work
Title: Short, clear, professional
Description (1–2 lines):
	•	Problem statement → what was the challenge?
	•	Your contribution / method → what did you do?
	•	Impact / result → outcome or value

CTA: “View project” → opens project detail page

Example (for your YOLO project):

[Image of segmentation output]
Title: “POI Detection with YOLO”
Description: “Automated extraction of points of interest from satellite imagery to support urban planning decisions. Implemented a YOLO-based pipeline for robust segmentation and polygon extraction.”
CTA: → “View Project”


Project Detail Page Structure

When someone clicks “View Project,” give them a deeper but structured look:
	1.	Project title + banner image → instant context
	2.	Problem / context → 2–3 sentences: why this matters, business or research challenge
	3.	Your approach / methods → what models, algorithms, or tools you used
	4.	Key results / outcomes → quantitative or visual evidence
	5.	Skills / tools used → optional, concise bullet list
	6.	Visuals / charts / maps / diagrams → make it engaging
	7.	Optional takeaway / reflection → what you learned, why it matters

Example for Gravity Model project:
	•	Problem: Predict OD flows in a city to optimize station placement
	•	Approach: Deep Gravity model with neural network + GNN for spatial patterns
	•	Outcome: Reduced prediction error by 20% compared to baseline
	•	Skills / tools: Python, PyTorch, NetworkX, Pandas
